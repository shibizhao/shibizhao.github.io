<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a forth-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science, Peking University, advised by Prof. Guojie Luo at PKU-DASYS Group (Design Automation for Next-generation Computing Systems). My current research area is Computer Architecture and I mainly focus on reconfigurable computing (e.g. FPGA, CGRA, and etc.). I hope to combine the advanced compilation and synthesis techniques with the reconfigurable architectures to build the next generation of efficient domain-specific computing systems. And I also have broad research interests including LLM, MLSys, and neuromorphic computing. I have published more than 15 peer-reviewed papers with total google scholar citations <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science from the School of EECS at Peking University in 2021. During the undergraduate studies, I mainly worked on the design of FPGA accelerators using High-level Synthesis (HLS). And I also worked as a research intern at Computing Technology Lab, DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group, where I had the priviledge of working with Dr. Yen-kuang Chen and Dr. Yuan Xie. 

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
